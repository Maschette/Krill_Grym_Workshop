# Krill_Grym_Workshop
This repository contains the code, notes, and data used for the CCAMLR workshop on running the Grym assessment for krill, as presented within WG-FSA-2021/39

A note on Rstudio setup for this workshop. You need to change the default rmarkdown setting for chunk reading to project. 
To do this, in Rstudio go to Tools -> Global Options -> Rmarkdown (on the left) then change "Evaluate chunks in directory:" to "Project"
